# GT stats extraction

Unfortunatelly, tools like Poker Tracker or Holdem Manager don't properly understand GT stats. This spreadsheet addresses that, synthesising the stats you should care about.

# Input

The data required is the PokerStars player audit. You can request it from the client:

* Tools
* History & Stats
* Playing History Audit
* Select the date range
* Add a password (this will be the password for the archive file, doesn't have to be your account password)
* You shouldn't care about StarsCoin/Reward point
* Select **Excel** as format

You should receive the spreadsheet in an email shortly.
